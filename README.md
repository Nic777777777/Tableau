Project Title: Interactive Data Visualization (Tableau) Tracking Complaints By State Over America / Analysis of Consumer Financial Complaints
 
-Analyzed consumer complaints data for 2016 and 2019 at the Consumer Financial Protection Board, utilizing Tableau to identify trends and geographical differences
-Observed a notable increase in complaints each month in 2019 compared to 2016, with an average difference of nearly 4000 complaints monthly, indicating heightened public awareness
-Employed advanced visualization tools including bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps, tree maps, and geographical maps to explore data and derive insights
- Reported a shift in complaint submission methods: web submissions rose from 30% to 50% of all submissions between 2016 and 2019, while postal mail submissions decreased from 2.53% to 1.50%
- Analyzed and presented timely response trends, noting improvements in response times by major companies suggesting effective complaint board operations
-Found that California had the highest number of consumer complaints, a key geographical insight that highlights the need for targeted consumer protection strategies in this state
